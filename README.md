## Abstract

Any person providing an online personal consultancy services always face the challenge of acquiring, managing and
retaining clients and delivery of the service over a disparate array of tools.  The primary problem is fragmentation of
these tools.  Social media platforms such as Facebook are great in providing the networking and promotional aspect of
things and while it is possible to run a business this way it is not the most effective and efficient means to an end.
Furthermore they are not designed to be business focused.
The goal is to streamline the experience and allow a service provider to focus on the service delivery and growing their
consultancy rather than having a inordinate amount of time managing clients.
