%\section{What problem are we trying to solve and why?}
Any person providing an online personal consultancy services always face the challenge of acquiring, managing and retaining clients and delivery of the service over a disparate array of tools.  The primary problem is fragmentation of these tools.  Social media platforms such as Facebook are great in providing the networking and promotional aspect of things and while it is possible to run a business this way it is not the most effective and efficient means to an end.  Furthermore they are not designed to be business focused.
The goal is to streamline the experience and allow a service provider to focus on the service delivery and growing their consultancy rather than having a inordinate amount of time managing clients. Consider the following user stories:

%\section{Consider the following user stories:}
\begin{itemize}
\item When deciding to offer an online service that involves interpersonal communication, Users want to be able to setup a personal page describing my services, so that I can manage the communication from the point of purchase right through to delivering my online service.
\item When users setup personal pages describing their services, Users want to be able to set their pricing and the times they are normally willing to provide services, so that a user can feel like they are in control of their consultancy and their client knows when they are ordinarily available.
\item When a user decides to avail of an online service that involves interpersonal communication, they want to be able to pay and have their account created if they do not already have one, additionally have their first session scheduled for them, so that they can manage their schedule accordingly.
\item A consultant will be able to setup an online consultancy within ten minutes without training and receive their renumeration for work completed within thirty days without having to chase up with clients for outstanding invoicing.  Additionally a client wonâ€™t have to waste any time chasing up with the consultant on asking how to pay for the service.  Double booking of clients should not be a problem as the system should provide adequate feedback when this is likely to occur.
